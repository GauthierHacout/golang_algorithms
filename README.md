<h1>Golang Algorithms</h1>

This repository contains :

- Basic algorithms (e.g sorting, randomizing, reversing...) & Data structures (e.g BinarySearchTree...)
- Algorithms created for LeetCode or CodingGame challenges

This repository was created as a way to train myself in the art of algorithms and keeping track of it !

Every algorithms are tested :
- Use ``go test -v ./tests`` inside the root directory if you want to see all tests
- Use ``go test -v ./tests/tester.go ./tests/name_of_file_test.go`` if you want to run a specific test
